## Refresh the committed WASM test fixture used by the upgrade tests.
##
## The fixture is checked in so the test suite compiles in CI without a WASM
## toolchain. That is what makes it go stale: after any change to the contract's
## code, re-run this and commit the refreshed fixture alongside the code change.
## The upgrade tests assert against the real build, so a stale fixture silently
## tests yesterday's contract.
